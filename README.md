# Worms-Engine
To test our knowledge on fundamental game physics we created a WORMS-like game. The game has at least one player worm that is able to shoot physics-enabled weapons/items to targets.

## Description

A 2D Worms like game to learn how to create a physics engine. 

## Key Features

- Many physical features like: bouncing, gravity, drag, hydrodynamic and aerodynamic, friction.
- Shoot the other players and kill them before they kill you, but don't try to swim
- Only one hp so don't kill yourself

## Personal Experience

Although is the second time we make this project, this time went a lot better than the last year and because of our new knowledge we didn't have a lot of trouble making it
